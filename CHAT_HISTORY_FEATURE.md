## 🔧 How It Works

### Backend Changes

**New File: `conversation_manager.py`**
- Stores conversation history in memory
- Manages sessions
- Provides history to LLM

**Updated Files:**
- `models.py` - Added `session_id` field
- `agents.py` - Added history support
- `langchain_agents.py` - Includes history in prompts
- `main.py` - Passes session_id to agents

### Frontend Changes

**Updated: `MentorshipInterface.tsx`**
- Tracks `sessionId` state
- Sends `session_id` with each request
- Receives and stores session from response
- Resets session when switching agents

---

## 📝 Usage

### For Users (Automatic!)

Just chat normally - **nothing to do!**

1. Ask your first question
2. Ask follow-up questions
3. Agent remembers context automatically

Example:
```
You: "I want to learn Python"
Agent: [Response with recommendations]
You: "What are the best resources for that?"
Agent: [Response that references Python learning]
```

### How It Works Behind the Scenes

1. First message → Backend creates session ID
2. Session ID returned → Frontend stores it
3. Next message → Frontend sends session ID
4. Backend retrieves history → Includes in prompt
5. LLM sees context → Responds with memory
